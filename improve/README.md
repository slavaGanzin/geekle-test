# Description
fibonacci.py contains naive implementation of fibonacci generator.

# Test
```bash
$ python fibonacci_test.py

# Fibonacci(0) took 0.000001 seconds
# Fibonacci(1) took 0.000001 seconds
# Fibonacci(5) took 0.000002 seconds
# Fibonacci(10) took 0.000021 seconds
# Fibonacci(20) took 0.002278 seconds
# Fibonacci(35) took 2.499871 seconds
# Total time for all test cases: 2.502175 seconds
# .
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ran 1 test in 2.502s

# OK
```

# Task
Improve fibonacci.py calculation speed using AI. 
1. Ask for improvement but don't give ideas how to do it
2. Give ideas how to impove (memoization, etc) it and see how well it implements your ideas
